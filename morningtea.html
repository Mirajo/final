	<h3>Try this for a morning pick me up</h3>
	<p><img src="images/morning.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Yah's Cuisine">In my quest for an ingestible, natural energy booster that would work almost as well as my favorite activity-based energy boosters—going for a 
	walk or bouncing on a big exercise ball—I happily discovered several great replacements for caffeine, with no nasty side effects when used properly. My top 3 are listed here.

	1. Ginger. This incredible root has a long and storied history as a natural digestive aid. And those of you who have suffered emotional stress and fatigue know that a malfunctioning digestive tract is u
	sually either the cause of such stress and fatigue or the result of it. Ginger, by helping ease the digestive process, helps us remain alert. I can also tell you from experience (and with the confirmation 
	of my favorite Chinese herbalist) that ginger speeds up our metabolism and circulation, not just our digestion. A single cup of fresh ginger-root tea can seriously make you sweat! I shave off several thin slices 
	from a fresh, organic root, and steep it in boiling water for 5-10 minutes. If I am running really low, I’ll chew the slices afterward, too. If you tend to run hot or have a metabolic disorder, please be careful. 
	A tiny amount of ginger is all any of us needs to get the energy boost we’re after: You really can get too much of a good thing when it comes to ginger.
